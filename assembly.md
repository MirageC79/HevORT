# Assembly Instructions
The Assembly is done in Layers where you build up the frame and mount all parts in the same time. 

This is done because drop in t-nuts are not recommended.

So before you start be sure to have all parts printed and all needed screws, rails, bearings, ... sourced as required. 

> It is highly recommended that you use the CAD files the whole time.
> 
> You will find every single part in it and can check how is everything assembled.

## 1. Prepare printed parts
- Prepare all printed parts so that they are fully assembled and can be mounted to the frame afterwards
- Add all bearings, screws, shafts, nuts and pulley
- As there are so maney different configs you have to check and use the CAD files to assemble everything 

### Used Parts:
- All parts flaged with MAKE
- Screws, bearings, idler, pulley, nuts

## 2. Build Frame
- Now we start bulding the main frame
- We will start from the bottom and build the first square
- Be sure to attach the L-joints in the extrusion
  - 2 in the X-Axis
  - 1 per side in the Y-Axis

### Used Parts:
- Corner Brackets
- 3030 M6 T-Nut
- M6x12 Screws
- L-Joints
- Extrusion

## 3. Add Z-Parts
- Screw the Z-Rails onto the extrusion
- Screw motor mounts to the extrusion
- Drop in both Z front extrusions
- Drop in the Z back "T" shaped
- Be sure to drop in the T-Nuts for ballscrew top mounts
  - 2x M5 T-Nut - X-Axis - facing inside of the printer

### Used Parts:
- Corner Brackets
- M6 T-Nut
- M6x12 Screws
- MGN12 Rails
- 3030 M3 T-Nut
- 3030 M5 T-Nut
- Z Motor mounts

## 4. Add Y-Layer
- Screw linear rails an extrusion
- Slide in both extrusions 
- The L-Joints are below the Rails - screw the L-Joint trough the wholes from the rail
- Be sure to drop in the T-Nuts for Y motor mounts and ballscrew top mounts
  - 2x M5 T-Nut both Y-Axis facing inside of the printer
  - 1x M6 T-Nut both Y-Axis facing inside of the printer
  - 2x M6 T-Nut both Y-Axis facing outside of the printer
- Slide in Y Motors and Idlers from the top

### Used Parts:
- M6 T-Nut
- 3030 M5 T-Nut
- M6x14 Screw
- MGN12 Rails with 
- L-Joints
- Y Motors and Idlers
- M6x12 Screws

### Userd Parts:
- Corner Brackets
- 3030 M6 T-Nut

## 6. Add Ballscrews and Printbed
- Add the ballscrews with wobble rings and mount them with the top idlers
- Atach the bed square to the ballscrews

### Used Parts
- M3x10 Screw
- M5x12 Screw
- Z Top Idlers
