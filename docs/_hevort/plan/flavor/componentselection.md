**Standard XY**|![alt text](/HevORT/images/hevort/XYThumb.png) <br> This version is suited for the commonly available GT2 pulleys.  These pulleys available from china and other location are 9mm thick and have wider flanges(lips).|April 2019|[HevORT XY](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4184477)
**XY High Temp**|![alt text](/HevORT/images/hevort/XYHTThumb.png) <br> The High Temp version of the XY gantry features 5mm bore pulleys.  These are slightly thicker (10mm) and have a narrower lips.  Note that due to extreme compactness of some components, transition bushings are necessary to fit the 5mm bore onto 3mm hardware.|May 2020|[HevORT XYHT](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4402495)
**XY Heavy Duty  HD9 & HD12**|![alt text](/HevORT/images/hevort/XYHD9Thumb.png) <br>![alt text](/HevORT/images/hevort/XYHD12Thumb.png) <br> This XY Gantry will fit on the same frame as the Standard and HT version of the XY Gantry.  The XYHD gantry are meant for very large printers or for the ones with very high performance in mind. Featuring: 9mm or 12mm 2GT Belt, Center Pulley Bore 5mm Dowell Pins, MGN12H instead of MGN12C and more...|Oct 2020|[XYHD9](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4629715)  [XYHD12](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4625509)| 


## Z Axis and Build Plate
Choose your weapon wisely ;)

Configuration|Description|ReleaseDate|Thingiverse
-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------
**ZR - RETIRED**|This initial version of the Self Leveling Z axis on MGN rails from the HevORT works just fine if you are using quality Ball screws with excellent frame alignment as well as perfect tolerances printed parts... Sounds impossible to get?  look at V2 below :)|Feb 2020|[ZR](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4184059)
**ZR V2 (Wobble wings) - RETIRED**|![alt text](/HevORT/images/hevort/ZRV2Thumb.png)<br> Some may say, get proper alignment, get quality parts, go back to lead screw... Well  The size of the bed on that printer makes it quite heavy.  Moving it down and up in a non planar printing mode will get standards lead screw to wear out pretty quick.  So for the ones of us who did not win the cheap ball screw lottery, this version of ZR system introduces Z wobble management using magnets and ball bearings.  Also a second thrust bearing was added to allow the use of a M10X1.00 nut to secure the ball screw better.|May 2020|[ZR V2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4387638)
**ZR V2.5**|![alt text](/HevORT/images/hevort/ZR_V2.5_Thumb.jpg)<br> Using the same Z wobble management as V2, this new version integrates 2 new features: First, A double row angular contact bearing is now offering better axial load support to the ball screw. Second, a quality shaft collar from Ruland is providing a better resting shoulder to the thrust bearing than the poor half lip of a thread the SFU1204 usually offers.|Jan 2021|[ZR_V2.5](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4723500)
HyperCube Evolution Z Adapters|_Upcoming._ This option will let you use standard [Hypercube Evolution from SCOTT_3D](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2254103) Z installation to your HevORT printer.|_TBD_|



## X Axis (Print Head)
Several versions are already published, but a lot more are being created by the community.  Search for HevORT on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) to find the latest.  
This list will capture the ones I created plus the ones from members of the [FB community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hevort/) that wish to have their work posted here.  All configuration here below include the [BLtouch from Antclabs](https://www.antclabs.com/bltouch) as a Z probe.
