# How to calibrate your HevORT... or any other printer!
 

1. Calibrate the Extruder step / mm.  
2. Perform PID tune of the Hot End and the bed.  You may want to create various PID tune profiles.  Since each material have their preferred printing temperatures and fan settings, I like to store the PID results into the [filament configuration file](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Filaments){:target="_blank"} of my Duet.
3. Calibrate the flow of your extruder/nozzle.  How much material is required to achieve the desired extrusion line width.
4. Calibrate pressure advance for the targeted print speed
5. Identify ideal temperature for material/targeted speed
6. Determine Ideal retraction setting
