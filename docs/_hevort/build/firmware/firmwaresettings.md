# Firmware Configuration

You made it!  your printer is assembled!  Congratulations :)  
Now you just need to get the Duet control board to know your HevORT. Time for Firmware Configuration!

Oh, and don't worry, We all got goose bumps when first hearing about _Firmware Configuration_.  It is totally normal to see this task as a monster.  I will help you to turn that monster into a fun one.  Remember, eventually that monster is going to work for you :)

I will be dropping things here as I am able to document them. If you feel you would be able to write one of these section, please contact me through the [FB support Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hevort/){:target="_blank"} .
