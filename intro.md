### Why the HevORT?  
I got into 3D printing by building a CoreXY Hypercube Evolution 300X300X300 (HEVO).  
This was a very good learning experience for me.  
After several months of printing and looking closely at the design from the HEVO I had some ideas for improving some areas based on my needs.
Well, first thing I know, I am now designing my own printer model using freshly acquired Fusion360 knowledge.  Pulling back my mecanical engineering course notes from way back then... 
I have designed what is now known as the HevORT (Hypercube Evolution Olivier RT).

### The Design Philosophy
- Stepper Motors to be out of the heat chamber and at back of printer
- Maximized ratio between XY print area vs frame dimension
- Triple Z motor Self-Leveling *(True term would be Auto-leveling , but the common use for Auto-leveling designates software compensation based on topographic mapping of the bed)*
- Wide and Tall front printer opnening without extrusion member in the line of sight to the print head.
- Rigid Gantry for achieving high acceleration and speed using direct drive extruder
- No metal machining of parts (or limited as much as possible)
- Open Source data

Hope you enjoy building and running this printer as much I do!
